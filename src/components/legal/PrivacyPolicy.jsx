        Privacy Policy for Dev2inder
      </h1>
      <p className="bg-base-300 p-4">
        Effective Date: 01/01/25 Welcome to Dev2inder! Your privacy is important
        to us, and we are committed to being transparent about how we collect,
        use, and manage your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains the
        details of our data handling practices. We collect certain information
        when you use our platform. This includes your name, email address, and
        password, which are mandatory for account creation. Passwords are
        securely hashed and stored in our database. Additionally, users may
        choose to provide optional details such as their age, gender, and
        profile photo. Payment information is only collected when users
        subscribe to our premium service. However, this financial information is
        handled by Razorpay, our payment processing partner, and is not stored
        in our systems. Our platform is intended for users aged 18 and above.
        Users under this age are not permitted to sign up or use Dev2inder.
        Collected data is used to create user profiles, allowing members to
        connect, communicate, and get to know one another before forming
        friendships. Email and passwords are used during login to authenticate
        users. Cookies are also utilized to verify user sessions and ensure
        security. We do not share your personal data with third parties or
        provide any external entities with direct access to the platform. The
        only exception is Razorpay, which processes payments independently and
        in compliance with industry standards. All user data is securely stored
        on MongoDB servers using cloud infrastructure, with strict security
        practices such as environment variables, password rotation, and
        encryption to prevent unauthorized access. Dev2inder allows users to
        manage their information freely. You can edit your personal data or
        delete your account at any time. Upon account deletion, all associated
        data is removed from our systems immediately. If you have questions or
        privacy-related concerns, you can contact us via the email provided in
        the Contact Us section of the platform. For users who use the messaging
        feature, communication is limited to friends who have accepted each
        otherâ€™s requests. Messages are private and only accessible to the
        individuals participating in the conversation. We take your data
        security seriously and comply with applicable privacy regulations, such
        as GDPR and CCPA. Updates to this policy may be made to reflect changes
        in our practices or legal requirements, and we will notify users in case
        of significant revisions. If you have any questions about how your data
        is handled, please feel free to reach out to us at
        arianothrowaway@gmail.com
